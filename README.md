Learning with Opponent-Learning Awareness
=========================================

Implements the LOLA ([AAMAS'18](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.04326)) and LOLA-DiCE ([ICML'18](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.05098)) algorithms.


## Installation

To run the code, you need to pip-install it as follows:

```bash
$ pip install -e .
```

After installation, you can run different experiments using the run scripts provided in `scripts/`.
Use `run_lola.py` and `run_tournament.py` for running experiments from the [AAMAS'18 paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.04326).
Use `run_lola_dice.py` for reproducing experiments from the [ICML'18 paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.05098).
Check out `notebooks/` for IPython notebooks with plots.

*Disclaimer:* This is a research code release that has not been tested beyond the use cases and experiments discussed in the original papers.
Contributions to further enhance and improve LOLA are welcome.
